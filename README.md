## Trie-Search

A Trie is a data structure designed for quick reTRIEval of objects by string search. This was designed for use with a type-ahead search (e.g. like a dropdown) but could be used in a variety of situations.

This data structure indexes sentences/words to objects for searching by full or partial matches. So you can map 'hello' to an Object, and then search by 'hel', 'hell', or 'hello' and get the Object or an Array of all objects that match.
